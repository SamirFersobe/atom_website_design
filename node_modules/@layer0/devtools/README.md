# Layer0 Devtools

In-browser devtools for the [Layer0](https://layer0.co/)

## Installation

### Libraries

You need both @layer0/devtools and @layer0/prefetch installed in your project

```
npm install --save @layer0/devtools @layer0/prefetch
```

### Service worker

You need to enable `@layer0/prefetch` in your service worker.

Check [our prefetching guide](https://docs.layer0.co/guides/prefetching), or [@layer0/prefetch README](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@layer0/prefetch) for more information

### Client widget

**Note**: you can skip this step if you are using `@layer0/next` or `@layer0/nuxt`

Then load the widget in the Browser's javascript

```js
import installDevtools from '@layer0/devtools/install'

installDevtools()
```

Alternatively you can also inject the widget install script directly in your HTML `<head>`

```html
<script defer src="/__layer0__/devtools/install.js"></script>
```

### Enabling or disabling the devtools

By default, the devtools is enabled when your app is served from `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` or any `*.layer0-limelight.link` domain.

But that can be customized:

#### Per environment

In Layer0 console environment, set the `PREVIEW_LAYER0_DEVTOOLS_ENABLED` to `true` or `false` to explicitly enable or disable the devtools on the given environment, no matter what domain it runs on.

#### Per user

Point your browser to `/__layer0__/devtools/enable` or `/__layer0__/devtools/disable` to explicitly enable/disable the devtools on your browser. This takes precedence over the environment config and the domain default.

If the devtools was previously enabled and you disable it, you may want to remove the service worker to get rid of the devtools-specific route handlers that were installed on-demand when enabling it. This can be done using the Application tab in Chrome Developer Tools.
