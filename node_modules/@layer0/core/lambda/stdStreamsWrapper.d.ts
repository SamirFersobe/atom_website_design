     * Notes:
     * - We have to wrap standard streams because some logging libraries (like 'consola')
     *   writes to those directly without going through console.xxx
     * - We have to wrap console.xxx methods too, as they don't seem to be bound to
     *   standard streams in AWS Lambda Environment. That wrapper (using pino) streams
     *   to process.stdout, leading to the point below.
     * - Both notes above would result in a double json encapsulation when logging via
     *   console.xxx methods. We prevent that in our standard stream wrapper by detecting
     *   a json string that coming from pino logger.
