# Layer0 Prefetch

Prefetching library for the [Layer0](https://docs.layer0.co), infrastructure to run your big, dynamic website frontend and make it load in less than one second.

The `@layer0/prefetch` package makes it easy to prefetch dynamic content cached at the network edge and store it in the browser's service worker cache.

You can read more about it in our [prefetching guide](https://docs.layer0.co/guides/prefetching)
